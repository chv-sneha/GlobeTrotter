# GlobeTrotter
GlobeTrotter– Empowering Personalized Travel Planning

Overall Vision 

The overarching vision for GlobeTrotter is to become a personalized, intelligent, and 
collaborative platform that transforms the way individuals plan and experience travel. The 
platform aims to empower users to dream, design, and organize trips with ease by 
offering an end-to-end travel planning tool that combines flexibility and interactivity. 
It envisions a world where users can explore global destinations, visualize their journeys 
through structured itineraries, make cost-effective decisions, and share their travel plans 
within a community—making travel planning as exciting as the trip itself. 

Mission

The mission for the hackathon team is to build a user-centric, responsive application that 
simplifies the complexity of planning multi-city travel. The platform should provide 
travelers with intuitive tools to: 

● Add and manage travel stops and durations 
● Explore cities and activities of interest 
● Estimate trip budgets automatically 
● Visualize timelines and plans 
● Share trip plans with others 

This involves constructing a solution that is both functional and insightful, powered by a 
well-designed relational database and a smooth frontend experience. Teams must focus 
on enabling users to organize personalized trips efficiently, stay within budget, and enjoy 
full visibility of their journey.
